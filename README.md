# The Todo App I Always Wanted

I've looked at quite a few apps that allow me to add a to-do list, but they always had features I thought were annoying, didn't use, or similar issues. So I decided to just make my own and that way I *have* to like it.

Features:
- Adding a todo
- Deleting a todo (via swiping to the right or left)
- Creating and changing the priority of a todo
- Reordering of the list via dragging
- A complete lack of time or date because I hate that

So, yeah. It's made with flutter, which is actually really great and made my life pretty easy.

Todos (ha ha joke):
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Put on Play Store
- [ ] Put on App Store (if I can compile it which I might not be able to)
